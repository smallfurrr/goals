## About the App / User Flow

The concept behind the app was that I simply wanted to be able to keep track of all my personal goals and keep myself accountable. 
Users are able to create new goals which then appear as cards on their dashboard. At one glance they can see all their current goals with countdowns to due dates, as well as the reasons behind setting each goal.
